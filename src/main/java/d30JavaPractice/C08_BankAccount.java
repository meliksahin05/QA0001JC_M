// Create a class called "BankAccount" with the following private properties: "accountNumber" (String), "balance" (double).
// Provide public getter and setter methods for the "accountNumber" and "balance" properties to allow controlled access to these properties.
// Write a method called "deposit" that takes an amount (double) as a parameter and adds it to the balance.
// Write a method called "withdraw" that takes an amount (double) as a parameter and subtracts it from the balance if there are sufficient funds; otherwise, print an error message.
// In the main method, create an instance of the "BankAccount" class, set the account number and initial balance, and test the deposit and withdraw methods.

    //set balance = 1000
