       LOGICAL OPERATORS

       AND: "&&" Represents AND operator ==> AND operator is perfectionist. Need all of them true get true in result
       ==> grade>70 AND grade<100
       ==> computer<2000 AND Computer>1000

       OR: "||" represent OR operator. ==> So generous. IF one is true, that is enough

       Tamara = 30  Nahed = 25  Ayse = 18

       Tamara <= 35 && Nahed > 25 =====> FALSE
       Tamara <= 35 && Nahed >= 25 =====> TRUE

       (Ayse != 19 && Nahed < 26 ) || Tamara == 28 ====> TRUE

        Operation Piority
        1) if there is paranthesis; inside parantesis is executed first
        2) Multiplication/Division; has first priority between the operators
        3) Addition/Subtraction; has second priority between the operators
