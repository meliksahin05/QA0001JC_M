    /*
    Java does not support multiple inheritance. It supports "Single Inheritance"
    Inheritance structures created with ine parent and multiple children are called.....

     "Hierarchical Inheritance" and java supports this....

     We can inherit like an apartment building on flat per floor...
     We can name it Multi Level Inheritance

     In java the relationship from parent to child is called HAS-A relationship (top to bottom)
     In java the relationship from child to parent is called IS-A relationship (bottom to top)
